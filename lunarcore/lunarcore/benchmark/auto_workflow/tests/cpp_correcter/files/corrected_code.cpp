Certainly! The provided C++ code has a minor syntax error. Specifically, it's missing a semicolon at the end of the `std::cout` statement. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```cpp
// C++ program that prints 'Hello World!'

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << 'Hello World!';  // Added missing semicolon
    return 0;
}
```

This corrected code will compile and run correctly, printing 'Hello World!' to the console.
