        Evidence from CIViC

Feature: ETV6
Description: nan
Summary: This gene encodes an ETS family transcription factor. The product of this gene contains two functional domains: a N-terminal pointed (PNT) domain that is involved in protein-protein interactions with itself and other proteins, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. Gene knockout studies in mice suggest that it is required for hematopoiesis and maintenance of the developing vascular network. This gene is known to be involved in a large number of chromosomal rearrangements associated with leukemia and congenital fibrosarcoma. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2008].
Molecular Profiles:
Evidence:
	- 3 members of a small four member pedigree with thrombocytopenia and tendency for hematologic cancer were characterized with an 85 gene panel. Thrombocytopenia associated RUNX1, CEBPA and GATA2 were not mutated. ETV6 mutation Pro214Leu (c.641C>T) segregated consistent with a dominant thrombocytopenia transmission pattern. The mutation was not found in Exome Variant Server or the 1000 genomes project. ETV6 P214L strongly reduced ETV6 nuclear localization and also reduced hematopoietic stem cell proliferation in mutant cells.
	- Two family pedigrees (one family with three generations and a small 4 member family spanning two generations) are presented. Exome sequencing was performed with 8 individuals from the first family, and sanger sequencing of ETV6 was performed on the second family. In the first family exome sequencing revealed ETV6 mutation c.641C>T or P214L, which segregated completely with thrombocytopenia. Two affected members of this family developed ALL. In the second family, this mutation was found via sanger sequencing. The mutation segregated with hematological deficiencies, where one affected member also had ALL. The variant was not found in 1000 genomes or dbSNP databases. In vitro experiments indicated reduced nuclear localization of ETV6 P214L compared to wild type ETV6 in cells.
	- 13 members of a larger pedigree with some affected by thrombocytopenia and propensity to hematological cancer were characterized with targeted sequencing of transcriptional repressor ETV6 and 84 other genes. ETV6 mutation Arg369Gln, or c.1106G>A segregated in a pattern consistent with a dominant transmission of thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia associated RUNX1, CEBPA, GATA2 were not mutated. One positive family member developed CMML, and another colon cancer. The mutation abrogated ETV6 DNA binding in gel-shift assay, and impaired hematopoietic stem cell proliferation was seen in ETV6 R369Q mutant cells.
	- Hematologic deficiencies and cancers were found to segregate in a dominant negative fashion with 5 genes discovered by exome sequencing of 5 members of a 10 member pedigree over three generations. Only transcription factor ETV6 mutation Arg399Cys (c.1195C>T) was then found in individuals not affected by hematological disease or hematological cancers. In vitro characterization of the ETV6 mutation showed reduction of nuclear localization in comparison to wild type and mutant ETV6 impaired hematopoietic stem cell proliferation.
	- HEK293T cells were transfected with wild type (WT) or mutant (P214L, R418G, 385-418del) ETV6 along with a luciferase reporter construct of one of the ETV6 transcriptional target genes (stromelysin-1/MMP3). Mutant ETV6 showed a decrease in transcription repression compared to WT. Mutant ETV6 was also show to mis-localize and dimerize with WT ETV6 which suggests a dominant negative effect.
	- In a study of 439 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, patients with ETV6 mutations (N=12) has worse overall survival than wildtype patients (N=427) (P=0.05 univariate). This difference was also observed after adjusting for IPSS risk (P=0.04) and multivariate analysis including IPSS and age (HR=2.04, 95% CI 1.08-3.86, P=0.03).

Feature: FAT1
Description: nan
Summary: This gene is an ortholog of the Drosophila fat gene, which encodes a tumor suppressor essential for controlling cell proliferation during Drosophila development. The gene product is a member of the cadherin superfamily, a group of integral membrane proteins characterized by the presence of cadherin-type repeats. In addition to containing 34 tandem cadherin-type repeats, the gene product has five epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and one laminin A-G domain. This gene is expressed at high levels in a number of fetal epithelia. Its product probably functions as an adhesion molecule and/or signaling receptor, and is likely to be important in developmental processes and cell communication. Transcript variants derived from alternative splicing and/or alternative promoter usage exist, but they have not been fully described. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
Molecular Profiles:
Evidence:
	- Drug resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors was analyzed in a genomic study of 348 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cases. Among patients treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors, those with FAT1 mutations had a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 2.4 months (95% CI: 2.0 - NR), compared to 10.1 months (95% CI: 8.7 - 12.2) for patients without FAT1 mutations (log-rank p-value = 2.2 × 10⁻¹¹). The impact of FAT1 alterations on CDK4/6 inhibitor sensitivity was more apparent in cases with bi-allelic inactivation of FAT1. FAT1 knockout and knockdown cell lines were created from the ER+, CDK4/6 inhibitor-sensitive MCF7 model to investigate this further. When exposed to 50 nM abemaciclib (a CDK4/6 inhibitor), the growth of parental MCF7 cells was completely suppressed, while FAT1 knockout or knockdown cells displayed resistance to the drug.

Feature: GATA3
Description: nan
Summary: This gene encodes a protein which belongs to the GATA family of transcription factors. The protein contains two GATA-type zinc fingers and is an important regulator of T-cell development and plays an important role in endothelial cell biology. Defects in this gene are the cause of hypoparathyroidism with sensorineural deafness and renal dysplasia. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2009].
Molecular Profiles:
Evidence:
	- This case study is on a 60-year-old man with a 7-year history of fatigue that was noted to have a palpable abdominal mass while being seen for gastroesophageal reflux disease. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a perirenal soft-tissue mass on the left side and similar soft tissue in the perinephric region surrounding the renal pelvis on the right side. A core-needle biopsy of the renal mass on the left side revealed infiltration of fibroadipose tissue with sheets of large histiocytic forms that were positive for S100 but negative for factor XIIIa. The immunophenotype and the presence of emperipolesis were consistent with Rosai–Dorfman disease. The patient received prednisone but had no response. This was followed by targeted next-generation sequencing of DNA from the renal mass with a 447-gene panel which identified a hotspot activating mutation in codon 12 of KRAS (p.G12R) at a variant-allele frequency of 8% (of 456 reads) within overall tumour cellularity of 20% (determined by a morphologic assessment); mutations were also found in GATA3 and GNAS that were of unknown clinical significance but thought to be germline in origin. KRAS-activating mutations result in constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that may be blocked by MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors. Therefore, we initiated treatment with cobimetinib (60 mg daily) for days 1 through 21 of a 28-day cycle. A repeat CT scan after 2 months of treatment with cobimetinib showed a substantial response.

Feature: MYB
Description: nan
Summary: This gene encodes a protein with three HTH DNA-binding domains that functions as a transcription regulator. This protein plays an essential role in the regulation of hematopoiesis. This gene may be aberrently expressed or rearranged or undergo translocation in leukemias and lymphomas, and is considered to be an oncogene. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016].
Molecular Profiles:
Evidence:
	- A research study performed in 2010 involved 57 pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and a comparison group of 59 pediatric high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Among the LGG group, there were 34 cases of pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) and 23 cases of diffuse gliomas, which included fibrillary astrocytomas (DA, n=14), oligodendroglial tumors (n=7), and angiocentric gliomas (AG, n=2). The study utilized SNP arrays and FISH to detect MYB rearrangements and quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IMHC) to analyze MYB expression levels. Gains involving MYB and MYB amplifications that upregulate MYB RNA and protein expression were demonstrated in 2/14 diffuse astrocytomas (DAs). No MYB fusions were detected in the two DAs, but the sequence from one DA was found to terminate within MYB exon 9. In addition, the study revealed increased MYB expression in both AGs, with one AG showing a focal deletion in the 3' terminal region of MYB. Overall, increased MYB expression by RT-PCR was seen in 8 LGGs, including 5 DAs, 2 AGs, and 1 oligodendroglioma, and in all three cases with MYB copy number aberrations. IMHC revealed an increase in MYB expression at the protein level in 60% of LGGs including 41% of PAs, and 19% of HGGs. Notably, genomic abnormalities were exclusively observed in diffuse gliomas. The findings suggest that MYB dysregulation may contribute to pediatric gliomas, particularly in diffuse gliomas, through various mechanisms beyond amplification and deletion.
	- Copy-number analysis was performed on 44 diffuse pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) to identify recurrent alterations. The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2), resulting in partial duplication of the transcription factor MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. A recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint between exons 10 and 11 of MYB on 6q23.3 was identified in two of four angiocentric gliomas (AGs). This study did not mention the partner genes involved in the MYB rearrangements in the two AGs. The results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.

Notably, genomic abnormalities were exclusively observed in diffuse gliomas.The findings suggest that MYB dysregulation may contribute to pediatric gliomas through various mechanisms beyond amplification and deletion.
	- Histological, molecular, and clinical analysis of 26 histologically prototypical isomorphic diffuse gliomas with a specific DNA methylation profile distinct from other glial/glio-neuronal brain tumors and normal hemispheric tissue were found to be most closely related to pediatric MYB/MYBL1-altered diffuse astrocytomas and angiocentric gliomas. IDH1/2-wildtype status was verified by Sanger sequencing of 24 cases with sufficient DNA. Integrating copy number and RNA sequencing data demonstrated MYBL1 (n=14) or MYB (n=6) alterations in 77% (20/26) of these tumors. Three tumors had MYB fusions with the gene partners, including HMG20A (n=1) and PCDHGA1 (n=2). These gene fusions resulted in a deletion of the C-terminal negative regulatory C-myb domain and/or a loss of the negative regulatory 3' miRNA-binding sites with an associated increase in MYB expression. Copy number analysis revealed gain or loss involving MYB in 3 tumors, including one tumor with gains involving both MYB and HMG20A resulting in two different MYB::HMG20A fusions and two tumors without MYB fusions detected. Increased MYB expression was observed in four (4/6) tumors
	- The study compiled the clinicopathologic and molecular features of 46 gliomas with a MYB or MYBL1 alteration diagnosed at a single center. The tumors showed low-grade histopathologic features and were broadly classified as diffuse astrocytoma (n = 11) or angiocentric glioma (n=35). Molecular alterations interrogated by immunohistochemistry (n=46), RNA sequencing (n=29), FISH (n=24), or PCR-based sequencing (n=11) revealed MYB (n=44) or MYBL1 (n=2) alterations in all tumors. None had alterations in IDH1, IDH2, TP53, ATRX, or histone H3 genes. Regardless of histopathologic diagnosis or anatomic location, DNA methylome profiling on 35 MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas formed a single cluster, supporting that MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas represent a single disease entity with a range of clinical and pathologic characteristics. Of the 11 diffuse astrocytomas with MYB (n=9) and MYBL1 (n=2) rearrangements, 9 had identified gene partners, including PCDHGA1 (n=5), LOC154902 (n=1), MMP16 (n=1), and MAML2 (n=1) with MYB and MMP16 (n=1) with MYBL1.
	- MYB amplification was detected in 28 of 263 patients with PLGGs using Fluorescence In situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The amplification of MYB was strongly associated with greater progression-free survival (p=0.04) but did not affect overall survival (p=0.13) [amplified (n=19) vs not amplified (n=177)]. MYB amplification was not an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis.
	- Comprehensive molecular studies (through whole genome, whole exome, transcriptome sequencing, genome-wide copy number analysis, clustering analysis by DNA methylation profiling, mutation hotspot analysis by Sanger sequencing, and FISH) were performed in a cohort of 91 low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LGNTs), including diffuse astrocytomas, angiocentric gliomas, gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas. Molecular alterations were detected in 31/32 (97%) of LGNTs with an astrocytic morphology, including 17 diffuse astrocytomas and 15 angiocentric gliomas, and no IDH mutations were detected in these tumors. MYB (n=5) or MYBL1 (n=2) rearrangement fusions were detected in 41% (7/17) of diffuse astrocytomas, while the remaining tumors had alternations involving BRAF (n = 4), FGFR1/3 (n = 4), and others (n = 2). The gene partners involving MYB fusions in diffuse astrocytomas included PCDHGA1, LOC154902, and MMP16 and the gene parterners involivng MYBL included MMP16. In contrast, a MYB fusion (most frequently MYB::QKI) characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (14–15). Only one other tumor across the series (an oligodendroglioma) had a MYB fusion (MYB::MAML2). MYB/MYBL-altered LGNTs clustered together with methylation profiling. The findings in LGNT with a predominantly astrocytic phenotype associating with MYB/MYBL alterations suggest a role of MYB/MYBL in these tumor categories with distinct characteristics.

Feature: NOTCH3
Description: nan
Summary: This gene encodes the third discovered human homologue of the Drosophilia melanogaster type I membrane protein notch. In Drosophilia, notch interaction with its cell-bound ligands (delta, serrate) establishes an intercellular signalling pathway that plays a key role in neural development. Homologues of the notch-ligands have also been identified in human, but precise interactions between these ligands and the human notch homologues remains to be determined. Mutations in NOTCH3 have been identified as the underlying cause of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
Molecular Profiles:
Evidence:
	- Finally, treatment of
CRC cells with anti-Notch2/3 antibody increased Numb protein while significantly reducing
formation of spheroids in both MICOL-14tum cells and primary tumor cultures. This novel feedforward
circuit involving DLL4, Notch3, Msi-1, Numb and Notch1 may be relevant for regulation
of Notch signalling in physiological processes as well as in tumor development. With regard to
therapeutic implications, Notch3-specific drugs could represent a valuable strategy to limit Notch
signaling in the context of colorectal cancers overexpressing this receptor.
	- Notably, the antitumor efficacy of OMP-59R5 in combination with gemcitabine was significantly associated with expression of human Notch3 gene in pancreatic cancer. Tumors that were more sensitive to the OMP-59R5 plus gemcitabine combination (responders) versus gemcitabine alone had higher levels of Notch3 baseline expression compared with tumors that showed no combination effect (nonresponders; Fig. 2B).
_______________
Feature: POU5F1
Description: nan
Summary: This gene encodes a transcription factor containing a POU homeodomain that plays a key role in embryonic development and stem cell pluripotency. Aberrant expression of this gene in adult tissues is associated with tumorigenesis. This gene can participate in a translocation with the Ewing's sarcoma gene on chromosome 21, which also leads to tumor formation. Alternative splicing, as well as usage of alternative AUG and non-AUG translation initiation codons, results in multiple isoforms. One of the AUG start codons is polymorphic in human populations. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 8, 10, and 12. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2013].

	- OCT4B1 (POU5F1 splice variant) expression reduced sensitivity to oxaliplatin (via P-gp and ABCG2 differential expression) in vitro.
_______________
Feature: YAP1
Description: nan
Summary: This gene encodes a downstream nuclear effector of the Hippo signaling pathway which is involved in development, growth, repair, and homeostasis. This gene is known to play a role in the development and progression of multiple cancers as a transcriptional regulator of this signaling pathway and may function as a potential target for cancer treatment. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2013].
Molecular Profiles:
Evidence:
	- YAP1 up-regulation of EGFR plays an important role in conferring therapy resistance to 5-FU or docetaxel in esophageal cancer (EC) cells. Inhibitor of YAP1, Verteporfin, can overcome the acquired chemo-resistance and sensitize EC tumors to 5-FU effects through inhibition of both EGFR and YAP1.
	- YAP1 and EGFR were found to be highly expressed in esophageal cancer (EC) cells and play an important role in resistance to 5-FU or docetaxel. Treatment of the EC cell line JHESO with the YAP1 inhibitor verteporfin had minimal effect on cell growth while verteporfin and docetaxel caused significant growth inhibition compared to either drug alone, as measured by MTS assay. Cell growth inhibition was attributed to decreases in YAP1, EGFR, and downstream AKT phosphorylation, determined by immunoblotting.
_______________
Feature: CIC
Description: nan
Summary: The protein encoded by this gene is an ortholog of the Drosophila melanogaster capicua gene, and is a member of the high mobility group (HMG)-box superfamily of transcriptional repressors. This protein contains a conserved HMG domain that is involved in DNA binding and nuclear localization, and a conserved C-terminus. Studies suggest that the N-terminal region of this protein interacts with Atxn1 (GeneID:6310), to form a transcription repressor complex, and in vitro studies suggest that polyglutamine-expansion of ATXN1 may alter the repressor activity of this complex. Mutations in this gene have been associated with olidogdendrogliomas (PMID:21817013). In addition, translocation events resulting in gene fusions of this gene with both DUX4 (GeneID:100288687) and FOXO4 (GeneID:4303) have been associated with round cell sarcomas. There are multiple pseudogenes of this gene found on chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 7, 16, 20, and the Y chromosome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2015].
Molecular Profiles:
Evidence:
	- CIC knockout conferred resistance to trametinib in NRAS Q61K (NCIH1200), KRAS G12C (CALU1), and BRAF V600E (HCC364) lung cancer cell lines.
	- CIC knockout conferred resistance to trametinib in KRAS G13D (HCT116) and BRAF V600E (HT29) colon cancer cell lines.
	- In a CRISPR-Cas9 screen in two KRAS G12V pancreatic cancer cell lines (PATU8902, PATU8988T), CIC was found to promote proliferation/survival in the context of trametinib treatment. Additional in vitro and in vivo studies in these cell lines showed that CIC knockout conferred resistance to trametinib.
	- CIC knockout conferred resistance to vemurafenib in BRAF V600E (HT29) colon cancer cells.
	- The cooperation of IDH1 R132H and CIC R201W mutations were evaluated in HOG and HEK cell lines transfected with wildtype and mutant forms. In the IDH1-R132H background, 2KG metabolite levels were increased in cells co-expressing F-CIC-R201W (p<0.0001). CIC was shown to interact with ACLY by reciprocal IP, and influence ACLY phosphorylation; cells transfected with CIC R201W showed reduction in pACLY (p<0.016) compared to wild type CIC.
	- CIC knockout conferred resistance to trametinib in NRAS Q61L (MELJUSO) and BRAF V600E (A375) melanoma cell lines.
	- CIC knockout conferred resistance to selumetinib in KRAS G12V (PATU8902) pancreatic cancer cells.
	- CIC knockout conferred resistance to vemurafenib in BRAF V600E (A375) melanoma cell lines.
	- CIC repressor activities were assessed in transfected HEK293 cells using a luciferase reporter controlled by a promoter containing CIC binding sites. The R215W mutation in the HMG-box of CIC showed decreased repressor activities in the reporter assay relative to wild-type. The association of CIC mutants to endogenous ETV/PEA3 gene promoters was tested by ChIP assay and R215W showed reduced ChIP signals compared to controls, representing reduced promoter occupancy. Similarly, a DNA binding assay found that HMG-box mutations including R215W reduced binding to a probe from the ETV4 gene, while a wild-type construct efficiently bound this probe.
	- CIC knockout conferred resistance to selumetinib in KRAS G12C (CALU1) lung cancer cells.
	- CIC knockout conferred resistance to vemurafenib in BRAF V600E lung cancer cells (HCC364).

Temporary conclusion:

For FAT1, strong correlation with resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors in ER+ breast cancer.
For GATA3, higher minimal residual disease under combination chemotherapy.
For TCF7L2, mixed responses to diabetes treatments and no relevance to cancer.
FAT1 – Supported (drug resistance)
GATA3 – Supported (chemoresponse modulation)
TCF7L2 – Less relevant
Others – Mostly no associations

Temporary conclusion:
YAP1 and WWTR1 map to Hippo pathway → associated with proliferation, drug resistance.
SOX9, SFRP1, TCF7L1 are involved in epithelial differentiation → supports EMT hypothesis in RD patients.
YAP1 – Relevant (Hippo, proliferation)
